- Chemical Engineering bachelors
  - (with a Biochemistry option)
- Chemical Engineering PhD
  - (applying picoNewton forces to chick forebrain neurons)
  - (also some Monte Carlo simulations of tubulin- and actin polymerizations)
- postdoc with Jim Bamburg (adf/cofilin co-discoverer)

### Reference means what?

- Sequence and coordinates on the molecules themselves
  - DNA (chromosomes, cDNA)
  - mRNA
- Annotation on the coordinate system
  - [BioMart](http://uswest.ensembl.org/biomart/martview/edea6a6cf7468c97141ac7db2f8fa1cf)
  - [UCSC Genome Browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu/)

#### Completeness

- completeness, meaning correctness (revisions)
  - single individual (ploidy?) vs population
  - natural variation? hypervariable regions?
- unknown regions
- unplaced regions

#### Circularity?
