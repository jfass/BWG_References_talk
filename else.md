## Other species ...

There are collections, but no true rhyme or reason. Mostly, inertia, user preference, and funding issues have led to a patchwork of references collections.

In no particular order:

- [NCBI's GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) and [EMBL](https://www.embl.de/) have their own browsers and entries for many species.
- [UCSC's Genome Browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway) hosts many vertebrates and other animals, and yeast and ebola.
- [JGI's Phytozome](https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/pz/portal.html) has many plants.
- [JGI's Integrated Microbial Genomes & Microbiomes project](https://img.jgi.doe.gov/) has many Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukaryota ... and 17 Unknowns!
- [VectorBase](https://www.vectorbase.org/) has many "Invertebrate Vectors of Human Pathogens" (mosquitos, etc.)

The level of information across all species varies widely, but it all comes from bench science. So, get back to work...
