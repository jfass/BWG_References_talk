## Humans ...

[GENCODE](https://www.gencodegenes.org/) is a good source for multiple versions of ... multiple versions of the human and mouse genomes. 

The current version of the human genome is "GRCh38" (GRCh = [Genome Reference Consortium](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/grc)), but there are many who still use GRCh37 (widely known as "hg19"). GENCODE has multiple "releases" (seem to be only annotation updates, not genome sequence changes).

See GENCODE's [Release history](https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/releases.html) for the full confusing picture.

But let's take a look at the options _within_ the most recent "Reference release (release 31)".
