### Broader Reference Issues

#### Completeness

- completeness
    - missing regions, known ('NNNNNNN') or unknown
    - correctness (revisions)
    - single individual (ploidy?) vs population
    - natural variation? hypervariable regions?
- unknown regions
- unplaced regions

#### Circularity?

- Generally, tools are "unaware" of the circular nature of plasmids or circular chromosomes.
- Fasta format has no widely accepted solution for circular sequences.
- BWA (popular read aligner) will mark reads aligning across the "break" (end / beginning) as "improper pairs."
